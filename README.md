This is a small weather app I created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It gives you the option to input a city or share your current location. You will recive the current weather, wind speed, humidity and temperature.

To run this project just open index.html.

This project is using openweathermap(https://openweathermap.org/) and Skycons(https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/).

To be added next:
    Weather effects(eg: snow, rain).
    Convert project to React.js.
